# Release Notes for krail-jpa 0.14.0.0 

## Containers
The ContainerProvider simply served as a placeholder for use in Krail, when Krail was at Vaadin 7.  Since moving Krail to Vaadin 8, there is no need for any form of Container, so these have been removed.

## Refactoring

A significant amount of refactoring occurred in other libraries.  Some of this may filter through to user applications.  Deleting the import statements and letting the IDE resolve references should be enough.
